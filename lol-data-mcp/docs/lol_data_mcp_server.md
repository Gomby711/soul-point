### ✅ **Task 2.2 - Comprehensive Item Data System** *(COMPLETED)*

**Overview:** Implement comprehensive item data system with differentiated data collection for completed items vs basic/epic items, assuming perfect item names initially.

**🎯 Core Approach:**
1. **Perfect Name Assumption**: Initially assume users provide exact item names (e.g., "Echoes of Helia", "Kindlegem")
2. **Differentiated Extraction**: Extract different data sets based on item type (completed vs basic/epic items) with dynamic section detection

**🔧 Architecture Requirements (Following Champion Pattern):**
- **Service Layer Pattern**: Business logic services that orchestrate scrapers (like stats_service.py)
- **Dynamic Section Detection**: Find sections by scanning page structure (like `_find_stats_section()`)
- **Item Type Classification**: Distinguish completed/basic/epic items (like `_detect_dual_form_http_fast()`)
- **Selenium Integration**: Handle expandable sections like cost analysis (like level dropdown interaction)
- **Two MCP Tools**: `get_item_stats` and `get_item_patch_note` (split from original single tool)

**🚫 No Hardcoding Rule:** All section titles, headers, and content discovered dynamically from page structure (means dynamic section detection, not avoiding CSS selectors entirely)

**📊 Item Type Differentiated Data Extraction:**

#### **Completed Items Data Requirements:**
Based on screenshot examples (Echoes of Helia, etc.):
- **Sidebar Info** (excluding recipe section)
- **Recipe** section with components and build path
- **Cost Analysis** (click expand button to show efficiency calculations)
- **Notes** section with gameplay tips and usage information
- **Map-Specific Differences** if they exist
- **Similar Items** section for alternative choices
- **Patch History** comprehensive change history

#### **Basic/Epic Items Data Requirements:**
Based on screenshot examples (Kindlegem, etc.):
- **Sidebar Info** (excluding recipe and builds info sections)
- **Recipe** section showing what it builds from
- **Builds Info** section showing what items it builds into
- **Cost Analysis** (click expand button to show efficiency calculations)
- **Similar Items** section for alternatives at same tier
- **Old Icons** section if available (historical versions)
- **Patch History** comprehensive change history
